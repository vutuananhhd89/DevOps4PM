- I was starting as an Automation Engineer in a factory environment -- was working with giant machines and also tiny micro processors. 

- Then, I prefer to switch to environments working more with people, collaboration in small teams -- it's when I started Project Management career.

- I started to learn the basic web development, HTML/CSS... to play the PM role in teams to build products from EdTech to payment gateways, and financial products.

- Along the journey, I found that -- Agile & DevOps are essential knowledge for PMs to work effectively with software teams.

    - Agile is already a common thing/ or even overused in PM community.
    - DevOps is the next thing for PM to be proficient. 
    - That's why I'm learning this & started DevOps4PM to learn with you all, PMs.
