- I was starting as an Automation Engineer in a factory environment -- was working with giant machines and also tiny micro processors. 

- Then, I made a switch to Project Management, working more with small teams to deliver software products.

- Along the journey, I was learning a lot with the teams from Web Development, System Design to **Agile & DevOps for continuous delivery**.
    - Agile is already a common thing/ or even overused in PM community.
    - **DevOps is the next thing for PM to leverage**. 
    - That's why I'm learning this & started DevOps4PM to learn with you all, PMs.
