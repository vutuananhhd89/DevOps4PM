## Introduction

This was the final talk in the GDG DevFest Hanoi 2024 with a lot of technology trends, practical insights, live coding sessions...
This one is not about TECH but more about PEOPLE, TEAMS and ways of working together. All of the frameworks, methodologies, practices... are to
build products that last.

Building products that last is not easy as 85% in 30k new products in the US failed after 2-3 years. & what does that mean for developers? 
Not only code but also the mind, heart, soul... could be wasted in those years. It's painful -- we should do something about it.

Of course, DON'T try using all of the frameworks, methodologies... it will be messed up if not solving real problems.

Instead, Do what makes sense as Developers, to solve problems in your context. 
Borrow a quote from Bruce Lee "Take things as they are. Punch when you have to punch. Kick when you have to kick."

It means being flexible to choose the way you work in your situations & Focus on long-term products.

## Why the main quest is building products that last?

If we only do short-term, we will not have NetFlix, SpaceX, GG or any lasting products like we have today,

NetFlix is a big example, they started with DVDs, sending DVDs through mails. Struggles with that in multiple years - cannot compete with Blockbuster 
But they keep iterating with the customer problems - when they meet & pivot to streaming, it gradually turned to today NetFlix

→ most important thing for developers are solving Customer Problems - then, customers are willing to pay for ur products
It's a single reason why your startup/ company will survive in long long time.

- Developers' jobs are not only coding.
- It goes deeper than that: to solve customers' problems.
- Customers' problems keep evolving forever - the same for your products.
- _“Main Quest for developers is building products that last”_

## How these methodologies can help you?

1 way to consider, is this Gartner research on how Enterprise Architects combine those things…
They try to leverage the best of each technique at different stages of customer problem solving journey

DT at the beginning, is strong with deeply understand customers, empathize with them, before clearly defining problems that's worth to solve
Lean - with the Build-Measure-Learn cycle to experiment the right products to build - decide to pivot or persevere if it's the right products.
Agile, DevOps to build product incrementally with feedback from customers

**Strengths of each “methodology”**

## Core elements of each technique? → explore the origins

To understand more about the techniques, explore their origins.
History of Agile, from 1970, from a paper of Dr Winston Royce, Waterfall model is borned & also other Adaptive methods,
But during that time, Waterfall model is dominant - & it's very good - it can bring people to the moon with NASA space projects 
- NASA used to require all vendors working with them follow Waterfall framework
90s - more movement from software, technology, see great software engineers… 
Agile, Lean for software development, DevOps are the beginning of the 21st century - they fundamentally changed how people work together


### Design thinking - a problem-solving framework focuses on Users

DT concepts started even from 60s-70s - not stick with software, but problem-solving framework can apply to any field
Main steps - Empathize with Users, their stories, emotions…
Then, can clearly define problem statements
Before, ideating ideas, solutions

Not necessary linear, not only empathize/ define once - but continuously refine problem to get it right


### LEAN Startup - build the right things
Multiple versions of Lean - original from Toyota in 50s-60s
Recommend the Lean StartUp version from Eric Ries - close to tech & software products
Repeatable Build-M-L cycles to build the right things - from Ideas - to MVP - meaningful Data - to make decision

### Agile - 4 values → mindset & culture
Favorite one, from 17 software engineers - for me, it marked the beginning of the 21st century
4 values & 12 principles, that guide the right mindset, culture for the teams/ developers to make decisions
Focus on individuals & interactions, working software that solve problems
Collaborate with customers and responding to changes to adapt to real customer needs

### DevOps Culture
Developers should be great at this already
- Not only tools/ techniques/ processes.
- Central parts are **PEOPLE**, mindset, culture.
- The beauty of DevOps lies in its adaptability—allowing teams to shape the ways of working.
  - To pursuit the _“Main Quest: building products that last.”_

## Key Takeaways

- Any of the techniques are good place to start.
- Focus on the core values, principles & empower teams to make decisions.
- The main quest is solving customer problems = building products that last.
- Ways of working will never stop evolving.
- You can shape your own way as needed.

There're a lot of ways to work - multiple versions DT, Lean; different frameworks in Agile umbrella, multiple variants of DevOPs…
Any of that is good place to start
But don't try to use all of them
Instead focus on core values/ principles - to empower teams to make decisions & focus on the main quest

Gradually, can define your owned ways/ principles - if we look at some big examples like Google, Amazon, the tip is they both start with customer
_Focus on the user, all else will follow_ (from the Google 10 things), obsess with customers (from Amazon Leadership principles) 
→ it's 1 guideance to **build products that last**.
