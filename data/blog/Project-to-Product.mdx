Some projects are struggle right from the beginning -- with the funding model that ties success with on time & on budget.

There's a better way to solve this by moving from **Project to Product** Model.

It all starts with **long-term thinking** instead of short-term celebration for on-time, on-budget.

Playing the short-term project games -- we're not likely to have NetFlix, SpaceX or any tech products like today.

Even if people said traditional project management is good enough to bring people to the moon ðŸš€ (through early NASA space initiatives),

**Good products take time** & multiple deliveries to really touch to & solve users' problems.

One good idea is learning from 'Project to Product', Dr. Mik Kersten with: Flow Framework, Value Stream Network... as the infrastructure of innovations...
